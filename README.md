## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- Proxmox VE 8.x installation (8.4.x recommended)
- Root access to the system
- Stable internet connection
- At least 5GB free disk space
- Console access (IPMI/iLO recommended for production)

### Essential Pre-Upgrade Steps

1. **Complete System Backup**
   ```bash
   # Backup all VMs and containers
   vzdump --all --storage <backup-storage> --mode snapshot
   
   # Backup configuration
   tar -czf /tmp/pve-config-backup.tar.gz /etc/pve/ /etc/network/interfaces /etc/hosts
   ```

2. **Update to Latest PVE 8.4.x**
   ```bash
   apt update && apt dist-upgrade
   pveversion  # Should show 8.4.x
   ```

3. **Ceph Users** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   # Upgrade Ceph to Squid before PVE upgrade
   # Follow: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Ceph_Reef_to_Squid
   ```

## üì¶ Installation

### Method 1: Direct Download (Recommended)

```bash
# Download the script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-USERNAME/proxmox-upgrade-scripts/main/scripts/proxmox-8to9-upgrade.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x proxmox-8to9-upgrade.sh

# Verify download integrity (optional but recommended)
sha256sum proxmox-8to9-upgrade.sh
```

### Method 2: Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/proxmox-upgrade-scripts.git
cd proxmox-upgrade-scripts/scripts
chmod +x proxmox-8to9-upgrade.sh
```

## üöÄ Usage

### For Testing Environments

```bash
# Run directly for testing
./proxmox-8to9-upgrade.sh
```

### For Production Environments

**ALWAYS use tmux or screen to prevent SSH disconnection issues:**

```bash
# Start tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s pve-upgrade

# Attach to session
tmux attach-session -t pve-upgrade

# Run the upgrade script
./proxmox-8to9-upgrade.sh

# If disconnected, reconnect with:
# tmux attach-session -t pve-upgrade
```

### Cluster Environments

**Upgrade nodes ONE AT A TIME:**

```bash
# Node 1: Run upgrade, wait for completion and verification
./proxmox-8to9-upgrade.sh

# Wait for node to be fully operational
# Verify cluster status: pvecm status

# Only then proceed to Node 2, then Node 3, etc.
```

## üîß Post-Upgrade Verification

After the script completes, verify your system:

```bash
# Check versions
uname -r          # Should show 6.14.x-pve kernel
pveversion        # Should show 9.x.x

# Check services
systemctl status pve-cluster pvedaemon pveproxy

# Clear browser cache and test web interface
# Press Ctrl+Shift+R in browser

# Test VMs and containers
qm list           # List VMs
pct list          # List containers

# Start any stopped VMs/containers
qm start <vmid>
pct start <ctid>

# Check logs for issues
journalctl -xe
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### GRUB/Boot Issues
```bash
# Fix UEFI boot problems
echo 'grub-efi-amd64 grub2/force_efi_extra_removable boolean true' | debconf-set-selections -v
apt install --reinstall grub-efi-amd64
```

#### Kernel Not Loading
```bash
# Check available kernels
ls /boot/vmlinuz-*

# Ensure GRUB is updated
update-grub

# Reboot if new kernel available
reboot
```

#### Service Issues
```bash
# Restart PVE services
systemctl restart pve-cluster pvedaemon pveproxy

# Check cluster status (if applicable)
pvecm status
```

#### Package Conflicts
```bash
# Fix broken packages
apt --fix-broken install

# Complete interrupted upgrade
apt dist-upgrade
```

### Recovery Procedures

If the upgrade fails:

1. **Check current status:**
   ```bash
   pveversion
   systemctl status pve-cluster pvedaemon pveproxy
   ```

2. **Attempt to complete upgrade:**
   ```bash
   apt update
   apt dist-upgrade
   ```

3. **If system is broken:**
   - Boot from rescue media
   - Restore from backups
   - Contact Proxmox support if you have a subscription
